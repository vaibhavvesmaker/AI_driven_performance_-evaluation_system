# Performance Measurement and Evaluation System

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end system for organizational performance measurement and evaluation. It includes data collection, sentiment analysis using NLP, object detection using machine vision, reinforcement learning for process optimization, KPI calculation, user acceptance testing, and reporting.

## Project Structure

- `performance_data.csv`: Dummy performance data.
- `survey_data.csv`: Dummy survey feedback data.
- `deploy.prototxt`: Caffe model configuration file for object detection.
- `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel`: Pre-trained Caffe model for face detection.
- `sample_image.jpg`: Dummy image for face detection.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the project.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- transformers
- gym
- opencv-python
- requests

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance-measurement-system.git
cd performance-measurement-system
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy transformers gym opencv-python requests
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Generate and preprocess dummy data for performance and survey feedback. Save the data to CSV files for further use.

### Step 2: NLP Model Development

Perform sentiment analysis on survey feedback using a pre-trained transformer model.

### Step 3: Machine Vision Model Development

Perform face detection on a sample image using a pre-trained Caffe model.

### Step 4: Reinforcement Learning Model Development

Implement a basic Q-learning algorithm for a simple environment (e.g., CartPole) to optimize processes.

### Step 5: Performance Metrics Calculation

Calculate KPIs from the performance and survey data to evaluate organizational performance.

### Step 6: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Simulate UAT results by evaluating KPI improvements before and after the implementation of the system.

### Step 7: Reporting

Prepare a summary report highlighting the KPIs and the effectiveness of the system.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an end-to-end system involving data collection, NLP for sentiment analysis, machine vision for face detection, reinforcement learning for process optimization, KPI calculation, UAT, and reporting using Python.
